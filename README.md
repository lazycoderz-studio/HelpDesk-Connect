# HelpDesk-Connect
## Overview
HelpDesk Connect is a real-time chat application designed to connect customers with agents for assistance. The system includes a queue management mechanism to handle multiple customer requests and ensure efficient agent-customer interactions.

## Backend Design (Golang)

####  WebSocket Server: Manages real-time communication between customers and agents.
####  Queue Management: Handles customer queueing and agent availability.
####  REST API: Provides endpoints for agent actions, such as picking a customer from the queue.
####  Database Interaction: Stores and retrieves data related to agents, customers, and chat sessions.


## Database (PostgreSQL):

####  Users Table: Stores information about agents.
####  Customers Table: Stores session details for customers.
####  ChatSessions Table: Stores details of chat sessions, including timestamps and statuses.

## Detailed Workflow
### Customer Workflow:

#### Initiate Chat:

Customer opens the chat page, inputs their name and email, and clicks "Start Chat."
Frontend establishes a WebSocket connection with the server using a unique customer_id.
Join Queue:

The backend server generates a unique customer_id and places the customer in the waiting queue.
The customer receives a message indicating they are in the queue.
#### Agent Workflow:

Login:

Agent logs into their dashboard and establishes a WebSocket connection using their agent_id.
View Queue:

Agent views the queue of waiting customers via their dashboard.
Pick Customer:

Agent picks a customer from the queue.
Backend server notifies the customer and opens the chat interface for both the agent and the customer.
####  Chat Session:

Real-Time Communication:

Messages are exchanged in real-time via WebSocket.
End Session:

When the chat is complete, the agent marks the session as complete.
Backend server updates the database, marking the session as complete and removing the customer from the queue.

## Concept of Agent and Supervisor
Supervisor are either the top level agent which interact with customer when agent are unable resolve the queries or training, evaluating and monitoring agents
Agents are persons who interact with customer.
